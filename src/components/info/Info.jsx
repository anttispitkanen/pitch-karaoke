        key part of startup culture
      </a>. And Pitch KaraokES is a fun and easy way to practice pitching!
    </p>

    <p>There are two different games to play.</p>

    <p>
      <Link to="/quickfire">Quick Fire Pitching</Link> is simple. You get a
      randomly generated company/product/service name and a limited time to
      pitch it in. Be creative!
    </p>

    <p>
      <Link to="/karaoke">Karaoke Pitching</Link> is what it sounds like. You
      get a five slide pitch deck with randomly generated content, and your job
      is to convince the audience that your business is worth buying from or
      investing in.
